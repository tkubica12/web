# Simple web app for container demonstrations

This is very simple web service written in Go to demonstrate cloud, load-balancing, containers. It is compiled to Linux binary package running on port 3000 by default, but PORT env can be set to different number. Web server returns MAC address of host server. V2 is the same, but string Version 2 is added (this is to demonstrate A/B testing or releases).
